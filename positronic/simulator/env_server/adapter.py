"""The ``EnvAdapter`` interface: the per-benchmark canonical<->raw mappings, on the client side.

``RemoteEnvControlSystem`` is a dumb translator — it moves data between pimm signals and this adapter.
The adapter is the smart half: it turns the Harness's command trajectories into the env's raw action
(owning trajectory playing and how to hold between waypoints), maps raw observations back to canonical
signals — policy-facing and privileged ground-truth kept separate — and reads the terminal. Each
benchmark ships one adapter (``vendors/``-style); the native ``MujocoSim`` fixture is the reference.
