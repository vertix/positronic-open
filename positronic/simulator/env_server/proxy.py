"""``RemoteEnvControlSystem``: a remote env server driven as one pimm control system.

A dumb translator: it owns the pimm ports (command receivers, observation + privileged emitters,
``robot_meta``, the Task's ``done``), the trial lifecycle, and the lifetime of the ``serve`` server it talks
to, but no command logic. Each control period it hands the latest command messages to the ``EnvAdapter``,
round-trips the raw action it returns over the wire, and re-emits the canonical signals the adapter maps
back — so only raw arrays cross the boundary and the World's virtual clock advances by the env's
``control_dt`` per step. The adapter owns trajectory playing, holding, and the canonical<->raw mappings;
``control_dt`` is whatever the latest observation reports (``reset`` and every ``step``).
