class Harness(pimm.ControlSystem):
    """Control system that manages episode lifecycle and forwards trajectories to drivers.

    The harness handles directives (RUN/FINISH/ABORT) and dataset recording. All inference
    intelligence (scheduling, error recovery, blending, absolute time stamping) lives in the
    policy/session layer — the harness just calls the session, demuxes the action dicts into
    per-channel trajectories, and emits.

    ``RUN`` may carry ``inference_latency`` (sim-only inference-cost simulation) in its context; the whole
    context is handed to the task's scene reset, which reads the per-trial keys it needs (e.g. ``eval.seed``).
    A ``trials`` plan (a sequence of RUN contexts) makes the harness self-driving: whenever it is
    idle it starts the next trial itself and exits once the plan is exhausted, so the unattended
    path needs no driver at all. A task's ``timeout`` bounds every trial it is given to — self-driven
    or operator-driven alike — so an attended episode still terminates at the deadline even if the
    operator never sends FINISH; a task-less attended session has no deadline and ends only on directives.

    A deadline-bounded trial also ends early when the privileged ``done`` signal is delivered within
    its budget: it records ``eval.terminated`` True and the delivered payload in its static data, a
    timed-out one False. A task-less session has no budget, so ``done`` does not terminate it.

    The ``Embodiment`` provides the observation serializers (which own the canonical key names),
    the command channels, and the home action; the harness reads them to assemble inputs and demux
    actions, treating every channel alike.

    The scheduling wrapper (``ChunkedSchedule``, or a swap-in like RTC) anchors the chunk's
    relative timestamps to absolute time, reading the clock the harness binds in at ``wrap``.

    Applies the given ``wrap`` pipeline to the policy; with ``wrap=None`` (the default) it runs the raw
    policy unwrapped. The eval entry points supply the standard ``ErrorRecovery | ChunkedSchedule`` wrap.
