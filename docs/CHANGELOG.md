# Changelog

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixes
- Fix PyPI installability: `openpi-client` moved from core dependency to optional `[openpi]` extra — resolves numpy version conflict with `rerun-sdk==0.30.0` that made `pip install positronic` fall back to 0.1.1
- DreamZero vendor now uses `positronic.utils.serialization` instead of `openpi_client.msgpack_numpy` (wire-compatible, same format)
- Default server port changed from 5000 to 8400

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31
